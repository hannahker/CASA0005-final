# Coding of Personal Comments 

This covers Section III of the methodology covered in my report.

We must now manually code the personal comments data according to their theme and direction of impact on anxiety levels. 

## Coding according to theme

Manually perform the following steps: 
1. Read through all comments and record, in one word, the primary theme that emerges from each comment. 
2. Group together similar themes. 
3. For each group of themes, identify the higher-level theme (again, in one word). 

## Coding according to direction of impact on anxiety 

Manually perform the following steps:
1. Read through all comments and classify the overall sentiment as positive or negative. 

Following this process, the personal comments data will look something like this: 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv('data/voice_notes.csv')

print(head(data))
```
