# Introduction and Description of Data  

This document offers a detailed walkthough of a procedure for processing, analyzing and visualizing data to examine changes in my levels of anxiety while I moved through space in London. 

This walkthrough requires the following two types of data, collected between Dec 4-Dec 14, 2019: 

1. Heart rate measurements, collected with a Fitbit Charge 2 device at intervals of approx 1-5 seconds. Also contains timestamp and coordinates for each measurement. There are a total of 15 .TCX files that contain data for different walking routes through the city. 

2. Personal comments, collected using a voice recorder and transcribed and stored in a .CSV file. 

This data is stored in an online repository: <INCLUDE LINK>
